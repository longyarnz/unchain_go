# ERC155 unchainNFT

## Intro
This app is an event listener for the ethereum block chain. It listens for transfer events for tokens on the ethereum blockchain. I wrote an erc1155 smart contract and added some methods to:
- create new tokens
- convert token id to descriptive names
- transfer tokens using names instead of ids  

I deployed my contract to the Ropsten netwrok using Remix and Infuria. I have added the socket URL and contract address to the env file. You may replace the values to listen to other contracts.
